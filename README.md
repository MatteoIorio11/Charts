# Charts
Crypto Coins charts made for the @MLH Orientation Hackaton

<h2>Why we have created "Charts"</h2> 


Nowadays with the new cryptocurrency fashion it is essential to keep an eye on the price of the various coins in real time, as some of these coins are very volatile but very precious. Through our application it is possible to have an immediate check on the price of a specific selected coin. Furthermore, our project could also be combined with market strategies to try to make possible future market forecasts. </h4>
